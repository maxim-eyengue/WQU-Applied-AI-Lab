    "In this lesson, we’ll dive into the **full wildlife dataset** 🌿, which features **eight classes of animals** 🐘🐅🦓. This is more than the simpler network from our previous notebook can handle. To tackle this, we’ll build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** 🧠🖼️, a more powerful type of neural network designed for image data. Our goal? To get the predictions needed for the **DrivenData.org competition** 🏆.  \n",
